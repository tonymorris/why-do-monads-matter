# Why Do Monads Matter?

The term monads has gained notoriety within programming, as some unattainable, mystical hurdle, which when conquered, takes the programmer to a new zen level. This apparent reputation is somewhat deserved, given the available descriptions that a curious student of FP must endure.However, it is not true.

In this talk, I plan to give a concrete and accurate definition for the concepts of monads. This is often the easy part. The hard part is ensuring that definition is first understandable, and that it can be correlated to a practical purpose for solving problems that any programmer currently experiences. The audience will have all of this tied together, in a structured, accurate explanation, with appeal to existing concepts that any programmer is able to empathise with.

In this talk, I intend to succeed in providing the audience with an ability to coherently and accurately explain to themselves the meaning, and practical purpose, of monads and how they relate to programming in general. With that, others can subsequently attain an accurate understanding and exploit the practical benefits of that understanding.

No more nonsense about monads.
